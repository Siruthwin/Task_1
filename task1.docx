    title Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
        what is HTTP 
            HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. 
            By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.
            There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2
            which was created in 2015.
        Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
         HTTP1.1:
            Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for the World Wide Web,
            HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server. 
            In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST. 
            In response, the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client.
            This is known as HTTP1.1 
        HTTP2:
            HTTP2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the intention of reducing web page 
            load latency by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.
            In HTTP2 the binary framing layer encodes requests/responses and cuts them up into smaller packets of information, 
            greatly increasing the flexibility of data transfer.

titel: Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
    JavaScript, as a versatile and widely-used programming language, employs a variety of data structures to store and manipulate information. 
    Among these, objects stand out as a cornerstone of JavaScript's power and flexibility.
    In JavaScript, an object is a complex data type that allows you to group related data and functionality together. 
    Objects are made up of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or a symbol) that maps to a corresponding value.
